<h1>The Best Movies According to Jeremy</h1>
<h2>The ones I love the most</h2><hr>
<p><h2>1. War <br></h2>
<p>The reason I love War is because it had two of my favourite actors: Jason Statham and Jet Li, <br> 
It was a show about betrayal and showed that even your best friend could turn out to be your worst enemy.<br> 
It is a classic in my eyes.</p>
</p>
<p><h2>2. 2 Fast 2 Furious</h2>
The Reason I loved this movie so much was because of the duo and partnership with Paul Walker and Tyrese Gibson<br>
It was especially a lovely movie, featuring cars that I liked at the time and the significance of brotherood was demonstrated.
</p>
<p><h2>3. RockNRolla</h2>
RockNRolla was a film that was about control and how your son could end up being the saviour of the show.<br>
It depicted a rollercoaster ride on who was betraying everyone and it led to the mob boss.
